Hi, <%= @user.firstname %>
================================================
  Did you know you are unable to use most of the sites features? As a matter of fact... You can't use any of the sites features...
  This is due to not being linked in with a Dietitian...

  What are you going to do about it?

  <%= @dietitian.firstname %> <%= @dietitian.lastname %>, wants to change that.

  All you need to do is take this lot of characters: <%=@dietitian.dietitianID%> head to your profile
  click on the 'edit profile' button and chuck it into the 'ConnectedTo' text field.

  The Dietitian will review the connection, and you'll be approved in no time!

  To login to the site, just head to myMealz.uqcloud.net

  Thanks for being a part of the myMealz future, and while you're at it, have a great day!
